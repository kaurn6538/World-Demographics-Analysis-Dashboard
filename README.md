# World Demographics Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Tableau project was developed under the assumption that I have been hired by the World Bank as a Tableau Developer. My first assignment was to create an animated dashboard that visualizes how the populations of different countries have evolved over the past 50 years. The focus of this analysis is on three key demographic indicators:

*    Fertility Rate

*    Life Expectancy

*    Population

## Objective

The primary objective of this dashboard is to provide stakeholders with insights into overall demographic trends worldwide. Additionally, the dashboard enables users to drill down into individual countries to explore specific historical trends from 1960 to 2013.

## Features

*    Animated Dashboard: The dashboard includes a year filter, allowing stakeholders to observe demographic changes over time in an animated format.

*    Fertility Rate vs. Life Expectancy Scatter Plot: This visualization shows how fertility rates and life expectancy have evolved across different regions and countries.

*    Bubble Size Representation: The size of each bubble represents the population size of the respective country.

*    Region-wise Classification: Different colors are used to categorize countries by region, enhancing the clarity of regional demographic trends.

*    Interactive Year Filter: Users can select specific years to analyze demographic data for that time period. Additionally, they can view historical trends for selected countries up to 2013.

*    Drill-Down Capability: Stakeholders can explore individual countries for a more detailed analysis of their demographic progression.

## Usage

1, Filter by Year: Use the year filter to visualize demographic changes for a specific year or watch the animation for a dynamic representation over time.

2. Hover Over Bubbles: Gain insights into country-specific data by hovering over bubbles to view detailed information.

3. Analyze Trends: Observe global and regional patterns in fertility rates, life expectancy, and population growth.

## Technologies Used

*    Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation

*    Public Demographic Data Sources: Data sourced from global population datasets

## Conclusion

This dashboard serves as a powerful analytical tool for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders interested in understanding the global demographic transformation over the past five decades. By leveraging animation and interactivity, the project successfully delivers meaningful insights into key demographic trends worldwide.
